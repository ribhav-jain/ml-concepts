    "# Streamlit Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create interactive and user-friendly web applications for data visualization, machine learning, and other data-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Features of Streamlit**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ease of Use**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Write pure Python code; no need for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.\n",
    "   - Leverages Python libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, Altair, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Interactivity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Widgets like sliders, buttons, text inputs, and dropdowns allow for dynamic interaction with your data or models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic UI Updates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Streamlit automatically detects changes in code and updates the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python First**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Integrates seamlessly with Python libraries, allowing you to use your existing tools and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Visualization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Support for various visualization libraries and custom chart generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - Deploy easily using platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud, AWS, GCP, or Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
